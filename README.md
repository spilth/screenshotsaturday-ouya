# Screenshot Saturday for OUYA

Screenshot Saturday is an OUYA application for viewing #screenshotsaturday tweets and posts on Twitter, Tumblr and Reddit.  It is inspired by sites like [screenshotsaturday.com](http://screenshotsaturday.com).

Eventually I'd also like to pull #soundtracksunday music/audio from SoundCloud. I have the very basics of that working.
